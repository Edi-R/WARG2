# WARG2

Slides for my talk at the second WARG (Western Australia R user Group) meet-up on interactive data visualisation with R. This 
covers neither Shiny nor ggvis, which should be discussed together next time. The source code is provided together with the 
resulting html files to enable replication by others.
